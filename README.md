# Endava-Project

    The problem:

   -When it comes to our planet, there is sadly no shortage of man made problems
   -One issue we chose to aid is the food waste problem
   -Approximately one third of all food in Romania ends up in the trash or is unnecessarily wasted annually. This amount corresponds to about 2.55 million tons of food      products
   -The discarded food combines with the already existing waste and begins a slow process of decomposition, which releases methane. Methane is one of the most powerful      greenhouse gases, 28x stronger than carbon dioxide
   -Food waste also means water waste: a burger needs 2500 liters of water to be produced


    
    How do we help?

   -Our little project exists to help our community with their food waste and reduce them as much as possible.
   -This is a big task that needs many steps to fulfill.
   -The first step we decided to make is to help businesses in minimizing the amount of great food they throw away each day by offering it to our users, thus making the    customer happy, creating a possible loyal customer and reducing how much food end up thrown away to rot in a pile.
